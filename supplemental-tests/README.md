# Supplemental Tests

If you add new functionality to the projects, please add tests for the new functionality.
Especially if you were too lazy to look at current tests and see if they fit your use case.

The reason to add your tests here is so the team can review your tests and see if they need to merge it with the existing tests

AND

It will help them understand the intention of your added feature.
