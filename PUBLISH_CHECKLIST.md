## 📋 Pre-Publication Checklist

### 1. Version Management
- [ ] Update version in `package.json`
- [ ] Create git tag: example - `git tag v1.0.0`
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md (if you create one)

### 2. Final Quality Checks
```bash
# Test build works clean
npm run build:check

# Test pure functions (should pass) - once fixed test against window as well
npm run test:pure

# Check what gets published
npm run publish:check

# Dry run publish
npm run publish:dry
```

### 3. Publication Commands
```bash
# Publish to npm (will auto-run tests and build via prepublishOnly)
npm publish

# Or for first-time publish with public access
npm publish --access public
```

## 🚀 You're Ready to Publish!

Your package is properly structured for npm publication. The build process works, TypeScript declarations are generated, and only the necessary files will be published while keeping all your development files organized locally.
